# Project Overview

## Introduction

**Project Portfolio 5 - Ecommerce for  [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full-stack course (5P)**

I have created this full-stack application using the Python, Django framework, Heroku PostgreSQL as well as front end technologies, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

In addition to this, I made extensive use of git, Gitpod and Github functionality.

## Goals

The goal for this project, was to allow users to register and confirm email address, create a profile which would store user order information, order history and favourited products as well as being able to log back in and log out again.

Users also have the ability to browse filter and sort products by name, price and category.

As well as allow purchases of products themed around coffee, with different weights that are reflective of pricing, favouriting products to save for later this also includes making reviews for products.

Visitors to the site may also subscribe or unsubscribe to a newsletter provided by mailchimp, and receive a confirmation email with their order, visitors may also use the contact form provided in the contacts section to contact an administrator and get a response within 1-2 working days.

## Purpose

The projects purpose is to enable customers/registered users to make purchases, register an account and review products while enjoying smooth user experience and user interface.
