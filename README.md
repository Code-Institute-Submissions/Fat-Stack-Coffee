# Project Overview

## Introduction

**Project Portfolio 5 - Ecommerce for  [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full-stack course (5P)**

I have created this full-stack application using the Python, Django framework, Heroku PostgreSQL as well as front end technologies, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

In addition to this, I made extensive use of git, Gitpod and Github functionality.

## Goals

The goal for this project, was to allow users to register and confirm email address, create a profile which would store user order information, order history and favourited products as well as being able to log back in and log out again.

Users also have the ability to browse filter and sort products by name, price and category.

As well as allow purchases of products themed around coffee, with different weights that are reflective of pricing, favouriting products to save for later this also includes making reviews for products.

Visitors to the site may also subscribe or unsubscribe to a newsletter provided by mailchimp, and receive a confirmation email with their order, visitors may also use the contact form provided in the contacts section to contact an administrator and get a response within 1-2 working days.

## Purpose

The projects purpose is to enable customers/registered users to make purchases, register an account and review products while enjoying smooth user experience and user interface.

## Project Future

This project has been built with the future in mind, post 1.0 release I am eager to implement further features, optimisation, new technologies, modernised design, styling improvements, added responsiveness and new features!

## Future Features

# User Experience

## UX

User experience has been designed with a minimalistic, clean and professional look.
A light coloured background and bold dark colours for text as well as sharp images to portray the purpose and goal of the ecommerce-site.

Customer can browse the site finding out more about featured products, as well as
find out more about the benefits of coffee, User can open facebook social links in a new tab, subscribe to a newsletter. Users have the ability to reach out to the site owner with the contact page as well as read more about the company on the about us page.


Users can also make payments via the checkout app using a credit/debit card via *[stripe](https://stripe.com/gb)* technology.

### Card Testing

## User Stories 

![User-Stories](https://res.cloudinary.com/matts-cloud/image/upload/v1653774696/user-stories-epics-fs-coffee_e0uqah.png)

I have created my user stories and epics using an agile approach and would like to continue improving on this aspect in the future with newer and updated previous projects.

I am planning to expand my knowledge on user stories and epics in the future and greatly expand them.

Future user stories planned for next sprint review.

- As a customer I will experience greater performance on the site.

- As a site owner I can the same products with different colours in one product.

- As a customer I can enter my post code or zip code and can select my address from a drop down input.

- As a customer entering details I can see input validation while I am typing in my details so I can be reminded and correct them.

- As a site administrator I can further customise the admin panel to enable easier management of the site and products.


![KanBanBoard](https://res.cloudinary.com/matts-cloud/image/upload/v1653780377/kanbanfsc_zcya6d.png)

All Github issues and project was created according to the MoSCoW to allow to plan and reach a consensus on resource allocation on the project.

How to Create a Kanban Board project and steps taken. 

1. Open project repository
2. Navigate to issues
3. Create issue tags 
    1. 'Must have' (Most important features)
    2. 'Should have' (Should be implemented)
    3. 'Could have' (Implement if there is time)
    4. 'Won't have' (Features that have been outside of current scope)
4. Create Github Project(Non-BetaVersion)
    1. Use Kanban board style.
5. Create columns consisting of
    1. 'to do' (Work that needs to be done)
    2. 'In progress' (Feature in development)
    3. 'Done' (Feature complete and tested)
    4. 'Future content' (Content implemented post-release).
6. Assign issues to columns as project progresses and development continues, deciding along the journey.

## Significance and Complexity

![Key](https://res.cloudinary.com/matts-cloud/image/upload/v1653774696/Significance-and-complexity-key-fs-coffee_rslwst.png)

7. All of the above have been Completed
    1. I have chosen Cloudinary over AWS as I am more comfortable with it.
8. I increased scope of the project after initial plannin, as I had more time than I expected.

## User Testing
<hr>

* My mentor gave me a feedback on design and styling of my project, which I had acted upon, improving padding across different templates as well as improving colour usage across the site.

* I have receieved feedback from fellow student Joanna Gorska, she gave me feedback about review button colours and some responsiveness improvements.

* I recieved feedback from code review channel on slack also by getting feedback on contact form not working as expected this has now been reworked and users should expect a reply within 1-2 working days.

* I was also given feedback about the footer and subscribe not being the same width to improve consistency this has also been resolved successfully.

* I asked my brother to test the site and he tested the site with an Iphone 13 Pro max as well as his desktop pc (2560x1440) he logged in with provided user details and tested purchasing an item as well as without an account, This test passed successfully.

* My friend tested my contact page form after bug fix and I can confirm that emails are being sent out to admin.

        ![SecuredVarExample](https://res.cloudinary.com/matts-cloud/image/upload/v1653828408/config-vars_en303z.png)

    3. Create Procfile containing application name to ensure proper formatting or deployment will fail.

    4. Commit and push changes to Github.

    5. Move to Heroku part of deployment.

    6. Create an account with [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/).

    7. Create a new app
        * Choose region
        * Choose appropriate app name
        * Add app name to Procfile

    8. In **Resources** add **Heroku Postgres** hobby plan.

    9. Within your newly created app
    go to settings go to **Config Vars**
    use the **DATABASE_URL** Value and add it to your env.py file and connect it via settings.py.

        ```
        import dj_database_url
        if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
        """
        Conditional import to prevent application
        error if it cannot find env
        """
        import env
        ```

        ```
        if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
            DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
            }

        else:
         DATABASES = {
            'default': {
            'ENGINE': 
            'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
            }
        }
        ```

    10. Create a **SECRET_KEY** Key and the Value as the desired key.
        * Add to env.py

    11. Next go to the **Deploy** tab next to **Deployment Method** click **GitHub** connect your account and repository.
        * You may choose manual deployment **[Here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)** Using Heroku Cli

    12. I **Recommended** enabling automatic deploys as it makes the process much easier and you update Github and Heroku at the same time.

    13. At the bottom of the page click deploy branch making sure it is set to **main** / **master**

    #### **Note.**

    This project uses Python and has to be deployed with a hosting platform such as Heroku as it handles backend functionality.
