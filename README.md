# Project Overview

## Introduction

**Project Portfolio 5 - Ecommerce for  [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full-stack course (5P)**

I have created this full-stack application using the Python, Django framework, Heroku PostgreSQL as well as front end technologies, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

In addition to this, I made extensive use of git, Gitpod and Github functionality.

## Goals

The goal for this project, was to allow users to register and confirm email address, create a profile which would store user order information, order history and favourited products as well as being able to log back in and log out again.

Users also have the ability to browse filter and sort products by name, price and category.

As well as allow purchases of products themed around coffee, with different weights that are reflective of pricing, favouriting products to save for later this also includes making reviews for products.

Visitors to the site may also subscribe or unsubscribe to a newsletter provided by mailchimp, and receive a confirmation email with their order, visitors may also use the contact form provided in the contacts section to contact an administrator and get a response within 1-2 working days.

## Purpose

The projects purpose is to enable customers/registered users to make purchases, register an account and review products while enjoying smooth user experience and user interface.

## User Stories 

![User-Stories](https://res.cloudinary.com/matts-cloud/image/upload/v1653774696/user-stories-epics-fs-coffee_e0uqah.png)

I have created my user stories and epics using an agile approach and would like to continue improving on this aspect in the future with newer and updated previous projects.

I am planning to expand my knowledge on user stories and epics in the future and greatly expand them.

Future user stories planned for next sprint review.

- As a customer I will experience greater performance on the site.

- As a site owner I can the same products with different colours in one product.

- As a customer I can enter my post code or zip code and can select my address from a drop down input.

- As a customer entering details I can see input validation while I am typing in my details so I can be reminded and correct them.

- As a site administrator I can further customise the admin panel to enable easier management of the site and products.

All Github issues and project was created according to the MoSCoW to allow to plan and reach a consensus on resource allocation on the project.

How to Create a Kanban Board project and steps taken. 

1. Open project repository
2. Navigate to issues
3. Create issue tags 
    1. 'Must have' (Most important features)
    2. 'Should have' (Should be implemented)
    3. 'Could have' (Implement if there is time)
    4. 'Won't have' (Features that have been outside of current scope)
4. Create Github Project(Non-BetaVersion)
    1. Use Kanban board style.
5. Create columns consisting of
    1. 'to do' (Work that needs to be done)
    2. 'In progress' (Feature in development)
    3. 'Done' (Feature complete and tested)
    4. 'Future content' (Content implemented post-release).
6. Assign issues to columns as project progresses and development continues, deciding along the journey.
